## üìà Strategy Details

### Season 2 Optimized Strategy

This bot employs a sophisticated betting strategy designed specifically for Apes Win Season 2 dice mechanics. The strategy dynamically adjusts bet sizes based on game patterns and streak analysis.

### Default Betting Strategy (Core Algorithm)

```python
# Actual code from bot.py (simplified)
def calculate_next_bet(balance, loss_streak, games_since_69):
    # Base bet starts at 10% of balance
    base_percentage = 0.10  # min_bet_percentage
    
    # Apply loss recovery multiplier
    if loss_streak > 0:
        recovery_multiplier = min(1.0 + (loss_streak * 0.15), 2.5)  # +15% per loss, cap at 2.5x
    else:
        recovery_multiplier = 1.0
        
    # Apply 69 pattern chase bonus
    if games_since_69 >= 15:  # chase_69_threshold
        games_over = games_since_69 - 15 + 1
        chase_bonus = min(1.1 ** games_over, 3.0)  # +10% compounding, cap at 3x
    else:
        chase_bonus = 1.0
        
    # Calculate final percentage (capped at max 25%)
    bet_percentage = min(
        base_percentage * recovery_multiplier * chase_bonus,
        0.25  # max_bet_percentage
    )
    
    # Calculate actual bet amount
    bet_amount = max(MIN_BET_AMOUNT, int(balance * bet_percentage))
    
    return bet_amount
```

### Base Strategy Details
- **Starting Bet**: 10% of current balance (adjustable)
- **Minimum Bet**: Never goes below a configurable safety threshold (defaults to 500)
- **Maximum Bet**: Capped at 25% of balance to prevent over-betting
- **Safety Threshold**: Auto-stops betting when balance falls below minimum threshold

### Loss Recovery System
- Each consecutive loss increases bet by **15%** (multiplicative)
- Formula: `base_bet * (1 + (loss_streak * 0.15))`
- Hard cap at **2.5x** the base bet to prevent excessive risk
- Automatically resets after any win
- Example progression:
  - 1st loss: 1.15x base bet
  - 2nd loss: 1.30x base bet
  - 3rd loss: 1.45x base bet
  - 10th loss: 2.5x base bet (capped)

### 69 Pattern Detection & Chasing
- Identifies the valuable "69" pattern that yields **10x multipliers**
- Detection logic checks for:
  - Combinations that sum to 9 (e.g., 3+6, 4+5)
  - Presence of 6 in the dice results
  - Contract-specific bit patterns (72 without double 3, or 112)
- After **15 consecutive games** without hitting the pattern, activates chase mode:
  - Increases bet by compounding 10% per game over threshold
  - Formula: `base_bet * (1.1 ^ (games_over_threshold))`
  - Hard cap at **3x** the base bet
  - Resets immediately when the pattern is hit
- Example progression:
  - After 15 games: 1.1x base bet
  - After 20 games: 1.61x base bet
  - After 25 games: 2.65x base bet
  - After 30 games: 3.0x base bet (capped)

### Strategy Combinations
- **Multiple multipliers stack**: Loss recovery and 69 chase can combine
- **Global cap**: Final bet is always capped at 25% of balance regardless of multipliers
- **Minimal intervention**: Strategy runs autonomously once configured
